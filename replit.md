## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server for fast hot module replacement
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query v5 for server state management (currently unused but configured)

**UI Framework:**
- shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design system
- Class Variance Authority (CVA) for component variant management
- Design system follows "New York" style from shadcn with custom color palette

**Design Philosophy:**
- System-based approach prioritizing clarity and trust
- Professional fintech aesthetic with calm visual design
- Blue background (#02066f) for distinctive branding
- Arial font family for clean, readable typography
- White input fields with prominent black borders (2px) for clear data entry
- Red Calculate button (bg-red-600) with white text for primary action prominence
- Contained layout with max-width of 672px (max-w-2xl) for focused interaction

**Component Structure:**
- Extensive shadcn/ui component library pre-configured (buttons, cards, forms, dialogs, etc.)
- Custom calculator page component (`client/src/pages/calculator.tsx`) with comprehensive features:
  - Core loan calculation with input validation
  - Amortization schedule generation and display
  - Extra payment impact analysis (monthly recurring and one-time)
  - Loan scenario comparison management
  - CSV export functionality
- Toast notifications for user feedback using shadcn toast system
- Collapsible components for progressive disclosure of detailed information
- Recharts integration for interactive data visualizations
- Path aliases configured for clean imports (`@/` for client src, `@shared/` for shared code)

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript for REST API
- ESM module system throughout the codebase
- Custom middleware for request logging with response capture
- Error handling middleware with status code and message normalization

**Development Environment:**
- Vite middleware integration in development for seamless HMR
- Custom Replit plugins for development tooling (cartographer, dev banner, runtime error overlay)
- Separate production build process bundling server code with esbuild

**API Structure:**
- Routes registered in `server/routes.ts` with `/api` prefix convention
- HTTP server creation returns server instance for potential WebSocket upgrades
- Currently minimal API surface - calculator logic runs client-side

**Storage Layer:**
- Abstract storage interface (`IStorage`) for database operations
- In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) as default
- User model with username/password fields (authentication scaffolding)
- Designed to be swapped with database implementation without changing application code

### Data Storage

**Database Configuration:**
- Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL via `@neondatabase/serverless`
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts` for code sharing between client/server
- Drizzle Kit configured for migrations in `./migrations` directory
- Zod integration via `drizzle-zod` for runtime validation
- Users table with UUID primary keys, unique username constraint

**Storage Architecture Decision:**
- Currently uses in-memory storage for development/demo purposes
- Database infrastructure configured but not actively used
- Migration path: Swap `MemStorage` for Drizzle-based implementation in `server/storage.ts`
- No session management configured (connect-pg-simple installed but unused)

**Rationale:**
- In-memory storage allows zero-configuration demo deployment
- Database schema serves as documentation for future persistence needs
- Loan calculations are stateless and don't require persistence
- User authentication scaffolding present for future feature expansion

### Build & Deployment

**Build Process:**
- Client: Vite builds to `dist/public` directory
- Server: esbuild bundles to `dist/index.js` as ESM module
- Production mode serves static files from built client directory
- TypeScript checking via `tsc` in check script (no emit)

**Environment Configuration:**
- `DATABASE_URL` environment variable required but may be unused
- `NODE_ENV` controls development vs production behavior
- `PORT` environment variable for server binding (defaults to 5000, auto-set by platforms)
- `REPL_ID` detection for Replit-specific tooling

**DigitalOcean App Platform Deployment:**
- Ready for deployment with pre-configured `.do/app.yaml`
- See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete deployment guide
- Supports automatic deployments on git push
- No database required - all calculations client-side
- Estimated cost: $5-7/month for typical usage

### 4. Extra Payment Calculator
- **Payment Types:**
  - Monthly Recurring: Adds extra amount to every payment
  - One-Time Payment: Adds extra amount to first payment only
- **Impact Analysis:**
  - New payoff time (months and years)
  - Months saved compared to original schedule
  - Total interest savings
- **Accuracy:** Properly clamps final payment to avoid overpayment
- **Recalculation:** Updates amortization schedule with extra payments applied

### 5. Loan Comparison Tool

- **Features:**
  - Custom scenario naming with auto-incrementing defaults
  - Individual scenario removal
  - Clear all functionality
  - Comparison table with 7 columns
  - Export to CSV
- **Persistence:** Scenarios persist across calculator resets until manually removed

### 6. CSV Export

  - Filename: `amortization_schedule.csv`
  - Columns: Month, Payment, Principal, Interest, Balance
  - Formatting: All monetary values to 2 decimal places
  
- **Comparison Export:**
  - Filename: `loan_comparison.csv`
  - Columns: Scenario, Loan Amount, Rate, Term, Monthly Payment, Total Payment, Total Interest
  - Formatting: Numbers to 2 decimals, scenario names quoted and escaped
  - Handles edge cases: Quotes in scenario names, various decimal inputs

- **Implementation:** Uses Blob API with proper resource cleanup (URL.revokeObjectURL)

## Technical Decisions

### Client-Side Calculation Strategy
All loan calculations run entirely in the browser for:
- Instant feedback without network latency
- Zero server load for computation
- Privacy (no financial data sent to server)
- Simplified architecture (no API endpoints for calculations)

### Amortization Algorithm
- Uses precise month-by-month calculation instead of formula approximation
- Handles floating-point precision with proper rounding
- Prevents overpayment in final month by clamping to remaining balance + interest
- Supports variable payment schedules for extra payment scenarios

### State Management Pattern
- React useState for all calculator state (no external state library needed)
- State includes: inputs, results, schedule, scenarios, UI toggles
- Immutable updates for arrays (scenarios) to prevent bugs
- Clear separation between base calculation and extra payment calculation

### Data Visualization Approach
- Charts source data from calculated results, not live inputs
- Prevents chart/data desynchronization when inputs change
- Sampling strategy for area chart improves performance on long schedules
- Responsive containers adapt to various screen sizes

## Code Quality & Testing

### Bug Fixes Implemented
1. **Extra Payment Overpayment Bug (Critical):**
   - Issue: Final payments exceeded actual balance when extra payments applied
   - Fix: Clamp each payment to `min(scheduled payment, interest + remaining balance)`
   - Impact: Ensures accurate interest savings and payoff calculations

2. **Chart Data Synchronization:**
   - Issue: Charts showed stale data when inputs changed after calculation
   - Fix: Charts now source from computed results state, not inputs
   - Impact: Charts always reflect calculated scenario

### Testing Coverage
- End-to-end tests verify all major features
- Edge case testing for large extra payments
- Input validation prevents calculation errors
- Export functionality tested with various data formats

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

- Bi-weekly payment schedules
- Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) calculations
- Property tax and insurance integration
- Refinancing analysis tool
- Downloadable PDF reports
- Chart customization options
- Historical scenario saving (localStorage/database)
- Print-friendly views

### Technical Improvements
- Unit tests for calculation functions
- Centralized CSV generation utilities
- Enhanced input validation with real-time feedback
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Performance monitoring for large schedules
